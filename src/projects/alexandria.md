---
Alexandria is a personal library app allowing you to track the books you're reading, want to read, and have read. It's my implementation of a project from the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree program.

## Skills Used
This project brief was designed to get me to use the recent skills taught in my Udacity React course.
* React
* APIs
* Routing
* JSX
* CSS
* Passing state to child components
* Composition
* Git/Github
* Netlify (Although it's seriously dead simple.)

### Libraries Used
These were both new, and welcome additions to my toolbelt.
* [Material UI](https://material-ui-next.com/)
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)

This one blew my mind a bit with just how short and to the point it is. I love it. He links to two other articles he knows on the subject and comes out and says he _also_ wants to explain it.

I get hung up on the fact that my stuff isn't going to be original so this is refreshing to see.

Five paragraphs and 4 codepens and that's the article.

I don't use `margin:auto` as much as I should, in combination with flexbox. I also am not fluent with `margin-inline-start` and `margin-block-start` so that's something to look into and get familiar with.

This one was just a short thought piece on a11y. I kind of expected the answer to be developed further, but I guess the answer is "It fails silently". The end of the piece seemed to offer more of a solution to the question "How do we make accessible sites easier to build?" rather than the actual title.

Either way it was just a handful of paragraphs and a photoshop mockup for an idea, and that's a solid blog post.

I think I'd like to write more pieces like this. Sharing opinions and getting feedback on them to help inform what I think and know about development is a useful thing.

This author writes with pretty dense paragraphs, but none of them were all that difficult to read.

In the comments I found the Vox Media Accessiblity guidelines, which were helpful. It also gave me a reminder to check for the silent failures like performance and a11y, not just waiting for the lawsuits to roll in.

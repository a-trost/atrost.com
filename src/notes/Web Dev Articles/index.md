This one blew my mind a bit with just how short and to the point it is. I love it. He links to two other articles he knows on the subject and comes out and says he _also_ wants to explain it.

I get hung up on the fact that my stuff isn't going to be original so this is refreshing to see.

Five paragraphs and 4 codepens and that's the article.

I don't use `margin:auto` as much as I should, in combination with flexbox. I also am not fluent with `margin-inline-start` and `margin-block-start` so that's something to look into and get familiar with.

# Figma, the Better Design Tool

This is an outline for a matchup of Figma vs Sketch. Figma is the superior design tool in many, many ways. This list is mainly a response to my personal pain points with Sketch and seeing how Figma alleviates them.

- Cross platform - Windows, Linux, and even Chromebook users can use Figma. You can even view (But not edit) your files on a mobile device.
- Web based - Everything is a URL. Everything exists on the web, and as soon as you create it, you can share a link to it. Rapid ideation and creation.
- Multiplayer brings in PMs, Engineers, and more stakeholders than Sketch can. The article “Why Figma Wins” explains this beautifully. “Sketch is a tool for designers, Figma is a tool for design.”
- Built in Prototyping. No need for Sketch + Invision
- Version control - Easy roll backs to previous versions because every change is saved. No more V1, V2, V3 in the file names.
- One Source of Truth - No more “Old” files where development spends time building the wrong thing. No need to hunt down or check for new files.
- An easy plugin system that syncs across everyone’s workspace.
- Generous Free Tier for people to get started
- Because the barrier to entry is so low (It’s a free app with a rather intuitive interface and many tutorials out there) I know many developers who are experimenting with design through Figma. This kind of app literacy helps them become powerful collaborators with designers within those Figma files.
- An API that opens up possibilities to companies who utilize it. Github uses it to sync their icons from Figma directly into a Repository.

A thorough argument for Figma is made [in this article](https://kwokchain.com/2020/06/19/why-figma-wins/).
